0 Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife
1 and his two children.  The boy was called Hansel and the
2 girl Gretel.  He had little to bite and to break, and once when
3 great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily
4 bread.  Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and
5 tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, what
6 is to become of us.  How are we to feed our poor children, when
7 we no longer have anything even for ourselves.  I'll tell you what,
8 husband, answered the woman, early to-morrow morning we
9 will take the children out into the forest to where it is the
10 thickest.
